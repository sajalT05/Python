//  To manually store data in a table, create a DataFrame. 

//  When using a Python dictionary of lists, the dictionary keys
        will be used as column headers and the values 
        in each list as columns of the DataFrame.

//  A DataFrame 
        is a 2-dimensional data structure that can store data of different types 
        (including characters, integers, floating point values, categorical data 
            and more) in columns. 
        It is similar to a spreadsheet, a SQL table or the data. frame in R.

//  Each column in a DataFrame is a Series 

//  When selecting a single column of a pandas DataFrame, 
        the result is a pandas Series. To select the column, use the
        column label in between square brackets [].

//  in pandas dataframe, the selection of a single column is very similar 
        to selection of dictionary values based on the key.

//  The data types in this DataFrame are:
        a. integers (int64), 
        b. floats (float64) 
        c. strings (object)

//      When asking for the dtypes, 
        no brackets are used! 
        dtypes is an attribute of a DataFrame and Series. 

//      Attributes of DataFrame or Series do not need brackets. 
        Attributes represent a characteristic of a DataFrame/Series,
                whereas a method (which requires brackets) do 
                something with the DataFrame/Series as 
                introduced in the first tutorial.
