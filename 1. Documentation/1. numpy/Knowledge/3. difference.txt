// Differences between NumPy arrays and the standard Python sequences:
    a. NumPy arrays have a fixed size at creation, 
        unlike Python lists (which can grow dynamically).
        Changing the size of an ndarray will create a new array,& delete the original.
    b.The elements in a NumPy array are all required to be of the same data type, 
        and thus will be the same size in memory.
        // The exception: one can have arrays of (Python, including NumPy) objects, 
        thereby allowing for arrays of different sized elements.
    c. NumPy arrays facilitate advanced mathematical and other types of operations on 
        large numbers of data.
        Typically, such operations are executed more efficiently and with less code 
        than is possible using Python’s built-in sequences.
    d.  growing plethora of scientific and mathematical Python-based packages are 
        using NumPy arrays; though these typically support Python-sequence input, 
        they convert such input  to NumPy arrays prior to processing, and they 
        often output NumPy arrays.
    e. in order to efficiently use much (perhaps even most) of today’s 
        scientific/mathematical Python-based software, just knowing how to use 
        Python’s built-in sequence types is insufficient one also needs to 
        know how to use NumPy arrays.
