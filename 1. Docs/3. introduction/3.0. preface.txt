// all arithmetic ope are done in interprator and codes.

// The interpreter acts as a simple calculator: 
    you can type an expression at it and it will write the value. 
    Expression syntax is straightforward: 
        the operators +, -, * and / work just like in most other languages 
        (for example, Pascal or C) 
    parentheses (()) can be used for grouping.

// Python can also manipulate strings, 
    which can be expressed in several ways. 
    They can be enclosed,
         in single quotes ('...') or 
         double quotes ("...") with the same result 
    \ can be used to escape quotes

// lists
    1. sliced and indexed like a string.
    2. can be changed.
    3. mutable

// string :
    1. is a list of characters.
    2. cannot be changed.
    3. immutable

// Python knows a number of compound data types, 
    used to group together other values. 
    The most versatile is the list, 
        a. which can be written as a list of comma-separated values (items) 
            between square brackets. 
        b. Lists might contain items of different types, 
            but usually the items all have the same type.
