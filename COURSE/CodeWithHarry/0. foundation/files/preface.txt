// RAM(Random Access Memory) 
1. Storage is fast and volatile. 
2. Data stored in RAM are lost once the program is terminated.

// ROM(Read only Memory)
1. Thus in order to store data forever, we store them in storage devices. 
2. Data is stored in storage devices in form files.

RAM--> volatile
ROM--> Non-volatile
