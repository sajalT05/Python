worst case: 
    calculate upper bound on the running time of algorithm.
    consider cases taht takes maximum time for operation.

average case:
    take all possible inputs, and calculate computing time for all of inputs.
    take average of all computing times.

best case:
    calculate lower bound on the running time of algorithm.
    consider cases taht takes minimum time for operation.
