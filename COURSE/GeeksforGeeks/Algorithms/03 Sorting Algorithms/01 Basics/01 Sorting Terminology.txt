An in-place sorting algorithm 
    uses constant space for producing the output (modifies the given array only). 
    It sorts the list only by modifying the order of the elements within the list.

Types Of Sorting :

    Internal Sorting
            a. When all data is placed in the main memory or internal memory 
                then sorting is called internal sorting.
            b. In internal sorting, the problem cannot take input beyond its size.
            Example: heap sort, bubble sort, selection sort, quick sort, 
                heap sort, shell sort, insertion sort.
    External Sorting
            a. When all data that needs to be sorted cannot be placed in memory 
                at a time, the sorting is called external sorting.
            b. External Sorting is used for the massive amount of data. 
            c. Merge Sort and its variations are typically used for external sorting. 
            d. Some external storage like hard disks and CDs are used for external sorting.
            Example: Merge sort, Tag sort, Polyphase sort, Four tape sort, 
                External radix sort, Internal merge sort, etc.

Sort Stability :

    Stable Sort
        a. When two same data appear in the same order in sorted data without 
            changing their position is called stable sort.
        Example: merge sort, insertion sort, bubble sort, merge sort.
    Unstable Sort
        a. When two same data appear in the different order in sorted data it is 
            called unstable sort.
        Example: quick sort, heap sort, shell sort.
