External sorting 
    a. term for a class of sorting algorithms that can 
        handle massive amounts of data. 
    b. External sorting is required when the data being sorted 
        do not fit into the main memory of a computing device 
        (usually RAM) and instead, they must reside in the 
        slower external memory (usually a hard drive). 
    c. External sorting typically uses a hybrid sort-merge strategy. 
    d. In the sorting phase, chunks of data small enough to fit in 
        main memory are read, sorted, and written out to a temporary file. 
    e. In the merge phase, the sorted sub-files are 
        combined into a single larger file.
    

When We do External Sorting :
1.  When the unsorted data is too large to perform 
    sorting in computer internal memory then we use external sorting.
2.  In external sorting we use the secondary device. 
    in a secondary storage device, we use the tape disk array. 
3. when data is large like in merge sort and quick sort.
4. Quick Sort: best average runtime.
5. Merge Sort: Best Worse case time.
6. To perform sort-merge, join operation on data.
7. To perform order by the query.
8. To select duplicate element.
9. Where we need to take large input from the user.
