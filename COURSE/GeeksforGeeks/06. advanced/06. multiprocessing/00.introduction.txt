// Multiprocessing refers to the ability of a system to support 
    more than one processor at the same time. 
    Applications in a multiprocessing system are broken to smaller 
    routines that run independently. 
    The operating system allocates these 
    threads to the processors improving performance of the system.

// A multiprocessing system can have:
    multiprocessor, i.e. a computer with more than one central processor.
    multi-core processor, i.e. a single computing component 
        with two or more independent actual processing units (called “cores”).

// multiprocessing module provides a Manager class 
    which controls a server process. 
    Hence, managers provide a way to create data that 
    can be shared between different processes.
