Hashing is a technique or process of mapping keys, 
    values into the hash table by using a hash function. 
    It is done for faster access to elements. 
    The efficiency of mapping depends on the efficiency of the hash function used.
    Hashing is a popular technique for storing and retrieving data as fast as possible. 

Basic Operations:
    HashTable: This operation is used in order to create a new hash table.
    Delete: This operation is used in order to delete a particular key-value 
        pair from the hash table.
    Get: This operation is used in order to search a key inside the hash table 
        and return the value that is associated with that key.
    Put: This operation is used in order to insert a new key-value air 
        inside the hash table.
    DeleteHashTable: This operation is used in order to delete the hash table

Hashing Components:
    1) Hash Table: An array that stores pointers to records corresponding to a 
        given phone number.
    2) Hash Function: A function that maps a phone number to an index in the hash table.
