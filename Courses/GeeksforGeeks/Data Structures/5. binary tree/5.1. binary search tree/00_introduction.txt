Binary Search Tree is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the 
    following properties:

    a. The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys 
        lesser than the node’s key.
    b. The right subtree of a node contains only nodes 
        with keys greater than the node’s key.
    c. The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.
