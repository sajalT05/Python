# # if-elif-else
# # upcoming elif and else conditions are taken in a loop with initial if statements
# a=int(input("Enter your number: ")) #take input as an number
# if(a>50):
#     print('value of a is greater then 50')
# elif(a>25):
#     print('a is greater then 25 but less then 50')
# else:
#     print('a is less than 25')

# # multiple if statements
# # each if condition is a new loop. every if statement is executed independently.
# b=int(input("Enter your number: ")) #take input as an number
# if(b>50):
#     print('value of a is greater then 50')
# if(b>25):
#     print('value of a is greater then 25')
# if(b>5):
#     print('value of a is greater then 5')

# # find string in a string
# string1='this is a string.'
# string2='string'
# if(string2 in string1):print('yes')
# else:print('no')
