NumPy’s main object is the homogeneous multidimensional array. 
...
It is a table of elements (usually numbers), all of the same type, 
indexed by a tuple of non-negative integers. 
...
In NumPy dimensions are called axes.
...
For example: 
    1. the array for the coordinates of a point in 3D space, [1, 2, 1], 
        a. has one axis
        b. axis has 3 elements, so we say it has a length of 3. 
    2. In the example 
    [[1., 0., 0.],
    [0., 1., 2.]], 
        a.  the array has 2 axes. 
        b.  The first axis has a length of 2,
        c.  the second axis has a length of 3.

// NumPy’s array class is called ndarray.
// It is also known by the alias array.

Note:
    a.  that numpy.array is not the same as the Standard Python Library class 
        array.array, which only handles one-dimensional arrays and 
        offers less functionality. 
    b.  The more important attributes of an ndarray object are:
