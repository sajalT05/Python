// NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python.
---
It is a Python library that provides:
    a. a multi-dimensional array object, 
    b. various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), 
    c. and an assortment of routines for:
        a. fast operations on arrays, 
        b. including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, 
        c. I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, 
        d. basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more.

// At the core of the NumPy package, is the ndarray object.
// This encapsulates n-dimensional arrays of homogeneous data types, 
    with many operations being performed in compiled code for performance.
