# # if-elif-else
# upcoming elif and else conditions are taken in a loop with initial if statements
# a=int(input("Enter your number: ")) #take input as an number
# if(a>50):
#     print('value of a is greater then 50')
# elif(a>25):
#     print('a is greater then 25 but less then 50')
# else:
#     print('a is less than 25')

# # multiple if statements
# # each if condition is a new loop. every if statement is executed independently.
# a=int(input("Enter your number: ")) #take input as an number
# if(a>50):
#     print('value of a is greater then 50')
# if(a>25):
#     print('value of a is greater then 25')
# if(a>5):
#     print('value of a is greater then 5')
