//  The Python interpreter is usually installed as /usr/local/bin/python3.11 
on those machines where it is available; 
putting /usr/local/bin in your Unix shell’s search path makes it possible to 
start it by typing the command:         python3.11

//  The interpreter operates somewhat like the Unix shell: 
when called with standard input connected to a tty device, 
it reads and executes commands interactively; 
when called with a file name argument or with a file as standard input, 
it reads and executes a script from that file.

//  start
    --> Python

//  end
    --> Ctrl-D. Ctrl-W, quit()

// A second way of starting the interpreter is 
    python -c command [arg] ..., which executes the statement(s)
    in command, analogous to the shell’s -c option. 
//  Since Python statements often contain spaces or other characters
    that are special to the shell, it is usually advised to quote 
    command in its entirety with single quotes. 
//  Some Python modules are also  useful as scripts. 
    These can be invoked using python -m module [arg] ...,
    which executes the source file for module as if you had spelled out its 
    full name on the command line.
//  When a script file is used, it is sometimes useful to be able to run 
    the script and enter interactive mode afterwards. 
    This can be done by passing -i before the script

// interactive mode 
    When commands are read from a tty, 
    the interpreter is said to be in interactive mode.
