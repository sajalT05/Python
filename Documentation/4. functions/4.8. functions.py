//  The keyword def introduces a function definition. 
        a. It must be followed by the function name and
        b. the parenthesized list of formal parameters. 
        c. The statements that form the body of the function 
            start at the next line, and must be indented.

//  The first statement of the function body can optionally 
        be a string literal;  this string literal is the function’s documentation string, 
        or docstring. 
    There are tools which use docstrings to automatically 
        produce online or printed documentation, 
        or to let the user interactively browse through code; 
        it’s good practice to include docstrings in code that you write, 
        so make a habit of it.
