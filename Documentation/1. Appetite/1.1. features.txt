Features: 
1. simple to use, 
2. but it is a real programming language, 
3. offering much more:
    structure and support for large programs 
    than shell scripts or batch files can offer.
4. offers much more error checking than C
5. being a very-high-level language, 
    it has high-level data types built in, such as 
        a. flexible arrays
        b. dictionaries. 
6. applicable to a much larger problem domain than Awk or even Perl,

Easyness--->

7. yet many things are at least as easy in Python as in those languages.
8. allows you to split program into modules that can be reused in other programs. 
9. It comes with a large collection of standard modules,
    that can use as the basis of your programs
    Some of these modules provide things like:
    a. file I/O, system calls, sockets, and even 
    b. interfaces to graphical user interface toolkits like Tk.

Interpretor--->

10. interpreted language, which can save you considerable time during 
    program development because no compilation and linking is necessary. 
11. interpreter can be used interactively, 
    a. which makes it easy to experiment with features of the language, 
    b. to write throw-away programs, 
    c. or to test functions during bottom-up program development. 
    d. It is also a handy desk calculator.
